# Installation

This page contains detailed instructions for installing the Toolchest R client.

If an installation problem persists, contact Toolchest directly, or [file an issue on Github with the encountered errors](https://github.com/trytoolchest/toolchest-client-r/issues).

## Base Instructions

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/trytoolchest/toolchest-client-r) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools") # uncomment to install devtools (prereq package)
devtools::install_github("trytoolchest/toolchest-client-r")
library(toolchest)
```

## Requirements
The R client requires a version of **Python 3.6 or greater** with 
development libraries (`libpython`).

Most installed versions of Python 3.6 or greater will have the necessary 
libraries installed with Python itself.

### Python on MacOS

For MacOS: The built-in `python3` version may not have the necessary libraries.
Installing Python from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) should provide a version
that does include them:

```shell
$ brew install python
```

### `$PATH`

If installing a new version of Python, make sure that the newly installed 
Python is on your `$PATH` environment variable.

<!-- TODO: add more detailed instructions about PATH -->


### Manually setting Python
If problems persist, try directing the R client to your Python installation
directly:

```r
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/path/to/your/python")
```
