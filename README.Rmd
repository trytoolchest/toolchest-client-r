Toolchest runs computational biology software in the cloud with just a few lines of code. 
You can call Toolchest from anywhere Python or R runs, using input files located on your computer or S3.

This package contains the **R** client for using Toolchest. For the **Python** 
client, [see here](https://github.com/trytoolchest/toolchest-client-python).


## [Documentation & User Guide](https://docs.trytoolchest.com/docs)

## Usage

Using Toolchest is as simple as:

1. installing the client (listed as the `toolchest` package) 

2. configuring Toolchest with your given Toolchest key:
```r
toolchest::set_key("YOUR_TOOLCHEST_KEY")
```

3. running the following:
```r
toolchest::tool_name(tool_args)
```

`tool_name` is the name of the desired tool, and `tool_args` is a string 
containing any additional arguments to be passed to the function.

Input and output paths can be specified as well:

```r
toolchest::tool_name(
    tool_args,
    inputs = "/path/to/input",
    output_path = "/path/to/output"
)
```

A list of tools can be found on the [Toolchest docs page](https://docs.trytoolchest.com/docs).

## [Installation](INSTALL.md)

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/trytoolchest/toolchest-client-r) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools") # uncomment to install devtools (prereq package)
devtools::install_github("trytoolchest/toolchest-client-r", dependencies = TRUE)
library(toolchest)
```

### R dependencies
The R client requires the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html)
package, version **1.25 or greater**. 

Install or update `reticulate` with:

```r
install.packages("reticulate")
```

### Python requirements
The R client requires a version of **Python 3.7 or greater**.

A compatible version will automatically be installed via miniconda or pyenv,
using R's `reticulate` package.

### Troubleshooting
For more details, see [the INSTALL page](INSTALL.md). If you're having trouble
with installation, consult the page and/or contact Toolchest directly.

    
## Configuration

To use Toolchest, you must have an authentication key.

Contact Toolchest if:

- you need a key
- you've forgotten your key
- the key is producing authentication errors.

Once you have your key, set the environment variable `TOOLCHEST_KEY` to the key
value:

```r
toolchest::set_key("YOUR_TOOLCHEST_KEY")
```
    
### .Renviron    

To prevent having to load the `TOOLCHEST_KEY` value every time R starts, you
can add the value to your `.Renviron` file. 

If you don't know what this is or if you're unsure if this file exists, use 
`Sys.getenv("R_USER")` in R to find the location of your home folder, and create
a file named `.Renviron`. Then, add the following line to it:

```
TOOLCHEST_KEY = YOUR_TOOLCHEST_KEY
```

where `YOUR_TOOLCHEST_KEY` is the value of your Toolchest key.

Note that these changes must be loaded in order to take effect. This automatically
happens at the start of each R session. 

After adding/editing an `.Renviron` file _during_ your R session, you can
proceed to load `.Renviron` into your current R session as follows:

```r
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
```

## Help / R Studio Documentation

Visit our main docs page at [docs.trytoolchest.com](https://docs.trytoolchest.com/).

Documentation for each tool can also be accessed within R, just like any other 
function in an R package. 
For help on how to use an individual tool, use either of the following:

- `help(tool_name)`
- `?toolchest::tool_name` (or simply `?tool_name`)
